# Build project

**Please make sure you have installed all [prerequisites](#prerequisites) first!**

download the project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nikoincc/esp32-wifi.git
```



# Flash build to esp 32



## Prerequisites

Linux/Mac users: Make sure you have the dependencies installed,that are mentiond in the [esp-idf install guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html#step-1-install-prerequisites). You **dont** need to manually install esp-idf, just its dependencies.

For detailed instructions see [Setting Up a Development Environment](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html) chapter of The Rust on ESP Book.

### Install Rust (with `rustup`)

If you don't have `rustup` installed yet, follow the instructions on the [rustup.rs site](https://rustup.rs)

### Install Cargo Sub-Commands

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install ldproxy
cargo install espup
cargo install espflash
cargo install cargo-espflash # Optional
```
> **Note**
>
> If you are running macOS or Linux then `libuv` must also be installed for `espflash` and `cargo-espflash`; this is available via most popular package managers. If you are running Windows you can ignore this step.
> ```
> # macOS
> brew install libuv
> # Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
> apt-get install libuv-dev
> ```
> Also, the `espflash` and `cargo-espflash` commands shown below, assume that version `2.0` or
> greater.

### Install Rust & Clang toolchains for Espressif SoCs (with `espup`)

```sh
espup install
# Unix
. $HOME/export-esp.sh
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%\export-esp.ps1
```
> **Warning**
>
> Make sure you source the generated export file, as shown above, in every terminal before building any application as it contains the required environment variables.

See the [Installation chapter of The Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/index.html) for more details.

### Alternative (for RISC-V Espressif SOCs **only**): install & use upstream nightly Rust and upstream stable Clang

While you **can** target the RISC-V Espressif SOCs (`esp32-cXX` and `esp32-hXX`) with the `espup` installer just fine, SOCs with this architecture are also [supported by the nightly Rust compiler](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/riscv.html) and by recent, stock Clang compilers (as in Clang 11+):

* Install a recent Clang. See [Clang Getting Started page](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) as it contains useful guidelines on instalaltion. Recent Linux distros come with suitable Clang already.
* Install the `nightly` Rust toolchain with the `rust-src` component included:
   ```sh
   rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src
   ```
* Run any Cargo command with the `nightly` [toolchain override](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html#overrides), i.e. `cargo +nightly ...`.
